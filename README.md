## Day-1-Introduction to Verilog RTL Design and Synthesis
<details>
 <summary> Introduction to RTL-Design, Test-bench, Simulators </summary>
-RTL Design : The RTL Design stands for Register Transfer Language. It sits between the high-level system specification and the lower-level gate-level implementation. This is a design abstraction which models the flow of digital signals between hardware registers, and the logical operations performed on those signals. RTL is preferred because it is easy to understand and implement compared to structural and behavioral models.

-HDL : A hardware description language (HDL) enables a precise, formal description of an electronic circuit that allows for the automated analysis and simulation of an electronic circuit.

-Simulator : Simulator is the tool used for checking adherence to the specification by simulating the design. iverilog is the tool used for RTL simulation. A simulator looks for change in the input signals and when no change in input, the output also doesn't change. It produces an output in the form of a .vcd file.

-Design : Design is the actual verilog code or set of Verilog codeswhich has the intended functionality to meet the required specifications. Design may have one or more primary inputs or primary outputs.  RTL design is the behavioral representation of the required specification.

<summary> Labs on examples of iverilog and gtkwave </summary>
We made a directory namely VLSI and inside that directory we cloned vsdflow and sky130RTLDesignAndSynthesisWorkshop repository. This repository consists of the required .lib files and verilog codes and its testbenches for practice.
I installed the needed tools and attached the required screenshots:

 <summary> Yosys </summary>
Yosys is an open-source framework for Verilog RTL synthesis. RTL stands for Register Transfer Level, which is a high-level abstraction used to describe digital circuits at the level of registers and their interactions. Yosys is primarily used in the digital design and electronic design automation (EDA) community to convert RTL descriptions of digital circuits, written in languages like Verilog or SystemVerilog, into a netlist representation that can be further optimized, analyzed, and eventually implemented in hardware.

I installed Yosys using the following commands and Below is the screenshot showing sucessful launch:

<summary>Labs on Yosys </summary>
 We were given the overview of this tool and the basic files required to perform the experiment on 2:1 MUX. 
 
 **Procedure** : First we need to read the liberty file using the code
 
 **read_liberty -lib <path of the .lib>**
 
 Then we need read the RTL Design code

 **read_verilog <RTL_Design_file>**

 After this we need to perform synthesis 

 **synth -top <instance_name>**
 
 generating netlist

 **abc -liberty <.lib path>**
 
This Netlist can be viewed in the synthesized circuit form using the **show** command

## Day-2-Introduction to Timing libraries, Hierarchical vs flat synthesis, and flip flop coding
<details>
	
 <summary> Introduction to Timing Library File (.Lib),Hierarchical vs Flat Synthesis </summary>
 
Liberty File(.lib) contains all std cells used in IC design their specifications are stored in .lib file. Also, Liberty File(.lib) consists of ASCII representations of Timing, Area, and Power associated with the Standard cell. The Naming convention in the timing file follows technology node and PVT format (Process, Voltage, Temperature).The Standard library used in our case was sky130_fd_sc_hd_tt_025C_1v8, File description 130 depicts technology node 130nm process is typical(tt), temperature is 25C, and 1v8 represents the 1.8V Voltage .
Screenshot of a standard library file shown below: 
<img width="1085" alt="lib" src="https://github.com/Avi991/Samsung-PD-training-/blob/e80dfe2463278a272ef026609f0bf2b1e7826dc4/Samsung_PD_%23day2/2.png">
	
The Liberty File also consists of the technology used for standard cells as in the above example it is CMOS, it also specifies the delay model, unit of time, unit of voltage, unit of resistance, and many other units.
All the data i.e std cells delays, leakage power, capacitance is stored in form of lookup tables(LUTs). For each gate cell based on the number of inputs(N), there will be 2^N combinations, and for each combination leakage power, area, delay, and all related parameters are mentioned. 

The timing file consists of many different variations of the same gate cells. As we move toward faster cell (cell with higher drive strength) the area and power increases. In liberty file area, power, timing values are given for same cell of different drive strength and it also consist if the inform about leakage power of all the possible logic of different configration shown below.

 <summary> Hierarchical vs Flat synthesis in Yosys </summary>
Hierarchical synthesis : The basic flow of hierarchical design is Dividing a design into multiple blocks (i.e. sub-chips, sub-blocks, modules, hierarchical blocks, etc.) which can also be user defined. Hierarchial design has blocks, subblocks in an hierarchy.
In Yosys we have done synthesis of a multimodule combinational circuit which consists of two sub_modules one that of ** AND ** gate and other of ** OR ** gate. Below is the RTL Design code of multimodules is gvien below:
	<img width="1085" alt="lib" src="https://github.com/Avi991/Samsung-PD-training-/blob/e80dfe2463278a272ef026609f0bf2b1e7826dc4/Samsung_PD_%23day2/4.png">

We do synthesis in yosys it generates the following gate level netlist :

<img width="1085" alt="lib" src="https://github.com/Avi991/Samsung-PD-training-/blob/e80dfe2463278a272ef026609f0bf2b1e7826dc4/Samsung_PD_%23day2/5(synthesis).png">

The yosys considers the module hierarchy and does mapping according to the instantiation i.e by using sub blocks.The netlist code for hierarchical implementation of the multiple_modules.

<img width="1085" alt="lib" src="https://github.com/Avi991/Samsung-PD-training-/blob/e80dfe2463278a272ef026609f0bf2b1e7826dc4/Samsung_PD_%23day2/7(synthesisize%20hier).png">

In the netlist it can observed that separate modules namely sub_module1 sub_module2 are created  i.e submodules are getting instanstiated not the std cells present in library

<img width="1085" alt="lib" src="https://github.com/Avi991/Samsung-PD-training-/blob/e80dfe2463278a272ef026609f0bf2b1e7826dc4/Samsung_PD_%23day2/6(show%20hier).png">

Flat synthesis : In Flat synthesis the hierarchies the flattened out and every submodule is created using std cells. We apply flat synthesis on the same design mentioned above. The command used to perform Flat synthesis from yosys are as follows :

--- read_liberty -lib <path of the .lib>

--- read_verilog <RTL_file>

--- synth -top <instance_name>

--- abc -liberty <.lib_path>

--- flatten

--- write_verilog -noattr <.v_File_name>
The synthesized circuit for a flattened netlist is shown in the below:

 <summary> Flip-flop Coding Styles </summary>
 Flip-flops :A flip-flop is a sequential digital electronic circuit having two stable states that can be used to store one bit of binary data. Flip-flops are the fundamental building blocks of all memory devices.

 The complexity of cobinational circuit increases the chance of glitch, hence FFs are used to avoid it and it stable output.

 <summary> Optimization Techniques </summary>
	
 The Optimization involves the reducing hardware in the design such that to improve area, power and speed. Two example where given:
 1. a*2
Consider a case where 3 bit number is multiplied by 2 in this case we dont need any additional hardware and only needs connecting bits to the output and grounding the LSB bit,same is realized by yosys. When binary number is multiplied by 2^n then result will gave same number by appending zero in LSB by n times.
RTL code:
	
```
	module mul2 (input [2:0] a, output [3:0] y);
	assign y = a * 2; // assign y={a,1'b0}
	endmodule
```

Yosys Synthesis result :

 2. a*9
Multiplying a 3 bit number by 9, gives results as concatination of same number twice {a,a}.
a*[8+1]= {a,0,0,0} + a(3bit)={a,a}

RTL code:

```
module mul8 (input [2:0] a, output [5:0] y);
	assign y = a * 9; // assign y={a,a}
endmodule
```

Yosys Synthesis result :

 <summary> Combinational Optimization </summary>
Optimising the combinational logic circuit means squeezing the logic to get the most optimized digital design so that optimized circuit area and power is saved. Various techniques and gives us the most optimized circuit.Implemented using synthesis tools
Command to optimize the circuit by yosys is ** yosys> opt_clean -purge ** to remove unused nets

 <summary> Sequential Optimization </summary>
There are various techniques for Sequential Logic Optimization

    - Sequentialal constant propagation

    - Advanced

        - State Optimization

        - Retiming

        - Sequential Logic cloning

Sequential Constant Propogation

For understanding we took asynchronous reset D Flip-flop is fed with d = 0(i.e GND) always so the output will always be 0 irrespective of the clock or circuit.

Advanced

State Optimisation: This is optimisation of unused state. Using this technique we can come up with most optimised state machine.

Cloning : It is an optimization technique that replicates a cell to reduce the load on heavily loaded cell. This technique is usually preffered while performing PHYSICAL AWARE SYNTHESIS. Lets consider a flop A which is connected to flop B and flop C through a combination logic. If B and C are placed far from A in the floorplan, there is a routing path delay. To avoid this, we connect A to two intermediate flops and then from these flops the output is sent to B and C thereby decreasing the delay. This phenomenon is called cloning since we are generating two new flops with same functionality as A.

Retiming : Sequential circuits can be optimised by retiming. The combinational section of the circuitry is unaffected as it only rearranges the registers in the circuit. It is a powerful sequential optimization technique used to move registers across the combinational logic or to optimize the number of registers to improve performance via power-delay trade-off, without changing the input-output behavior of the circuit.

**Example 1**
```
module dff_const2(input clk, input reset, output reg q);
	always @(posedge clk, posedge reset)
	begin
		if(reset)
			q <= 1'b1;
		else
			q <= 1'b1;
	end
endmodule

As we know the above code is for a d flipflop with an asynchronous reset this is used to reset the system asynchronously and later the system comes into normal oprtaion for next 1 clk that is synchronously so this system cannot be further optimized and a flipflop is generated 

**Example 2**
```
module dff_const2(input clk, input reset, output reg q);
	always @(posedge clk, posedge reset)
	begin
		if(reset)
			q <= 1'b1;
		else
			q <= 1'b1;

## Day-4- GLS Blocking vs Non-Blocking And Synthesis-Simulation Mismatch 
<details>
<summary> GLS Concepts And Flow Using Iverilog </summary>

-- What is GLS- Gate Level Simulation?:
GLS is generating the simulation output by running test bench with netlist file generated from synthesis as design under test. Netlist is logically same as RTL code, hence, same test bench can be used for it.

-- Why GLS?:
We perform this to verify logical correctness of the design after synthesizing it. 

If GLS is run with delay annotion then it can be used for timing analysis 

**Synthesis Simulation Mismatch** 

Synthesis simulation mismatch denotes the discrepancy between the actual behavior of a circuit as simulated during design and its real-world performance after synthesizing the design. 

Synthesis simulation mismatched are mainly caused because of the following reasons 

- Missing sensitivity list
- Blocking vs Non Blocking assignments
- Non standard verilog code

**Missing sensitivity list**
The absence of a complete sensitivity list in VLSI design can give rise to problems. In hardware description languages (HDL) like Verilog, a sensitivity list is utilized to specify the inputs that should activate the execution of a specific process or code block. Inadequate or missing signals in the sensitivity list can lead to inaccurate or unforeseen behavior of the circuit during synthesis or simulation. Ensuring an accurate representation of inputs impacting the logic within a process is vital.

As the synthesizer does not look for sensitivity list and it looks only statements in the procedural block , it infers correct circuit and if we simulate the netlist code , there will be synthesis simulation mismatch. In to order tackle this issue this issue it is important to check the behaviour of the circuit first and then match it with the expected output seen in the simulation. 

**Blocking Vs Non Blocking Assignments**

Blocking statements execute the will wait for the current one to finish.i.e. sequentially inside the always block. 
Non-Blocking statements execute all the assignment parallelly inside a always block.First all the RHS is evaluated and then assigned
This will give mismatch as sometimes, improper use of blocking statements can create latches. 

Missing sensitivity list in always block:
Lets take example of mux having inputs as i0,i1 and sel and output as y.
```
always @(sel)                  always @(*)
//It will infer a latch        // It will infer a mux.
```
If i0 and i1 change in activity will not be reflected in always block.
To avoid the synthesis and simulation mismatch. It is very important to check the behaviour of the circuit first and then match it with the expected output seen in simulation and make sure there are no synthesis and simulation mismatches. This is why we use GLS.

From the output we can infer the netlist simulation which corrects the bad_mux design which was only changing waveform when sel was triggered while for a mux to work properly it should be sensitivity to all the input signals. No change in activities of input signal is recorded

## Day-6-Introduction to logic synthesis in DC

<details>
<summary> Introduction </summary>

**Synthesis**
-RTL to Gate level translation.

-The design is converted inta gate and connections are made betn the gates.

-INPUT to Synthesis :     (1) RTL    (2) .lib

**Contents of .lib**
A typical Liberty file contains detailed information about the behaviour of standard cells, including :
    *Timing Information : This includes delay, transition and capacitance values associated with the standard cells. Timing information specifies how the cells behave under different input conditions.
    
    *Optimization : Synthesis tools perform optimization to improve the design's performance, area, and power consumption.Logic optimization algorithms identify redundant logic and simplify the gate-level 
     representation to achieve a more efficient implementation.
     
    *Technology Mapping : During synthesis, the design is mapped to a specific target technology library that contains the available gates and flip-flops for the manufacturing process being used (e.g., 28nm, 
      7nm, etc.).The choice of gates from the library is critical in determining the final characteristics of the integrated circuit.
      
    *Power Information : Liberty file also provides data on power consumption , including static power and dynamic power characteristics. This information is crucial for optimizing the power consumption in IC.
  
    *Functional Behaviour : Descriptions of the logical functionality of standard cells, such as input and output pins and logical equations and any additional attributesthat define their operation.
    
    *Operating Conditions : Liberty files may include information about different operating condition in terms of process , voltage and temperature under which all cells are characterized.
     
    *Output for Further Stages : The gate-level netlist produced by synthesis serves as the input for subsequent stages of the design flow, including physical design, place-and-route, and manufacturing.
    

**Need of Liberty files**:

Timing Analysis : EDA tools use Liberty files to perform static timing analysis, ensuring that the IC design meets specified timing constraints. This is critical for achieving desired performance targets.

Power Optimization : Power consumption is a significant concern in modern IC design. Liberty files provide power data that allows designers to optimize power usage and meet energy efficiency goals.

Design Closure : During the design process, designers use Liberty files to guide the synthesis, placement, and routing of standard cells. The data in these files helps achieve design closure by ensuring that the design meets performance, power, and area targets.

Variability Handling : Variability in manufacturing processes can impact the behavior of standard cells. Liberty files may include data for different process corners to account for manufacturing variations.



**Constraints**
Constraints are the instructions that the designer apply during various step in VLSI chip implementation, such as logic synthesis, clock tree synthesis, Place and Route, and Static Timing Analysis. They define what the tools can or cannot do with the design or how the tool behaves. In VLSI design, constraints are essential parameters and limitations that guide the development process to ensure that the resulting integrated circuits (ICs) meet specific performance, timing, and functionality requirements. These constraints play a crucial role in achieving a successful VLSI design.

<summary> DC Complier </summary>

Design Compiler ,  is a high-level synthesis tool developed by Synopsys, a leading provider of EDA solutions. It plays a pivotal role in the process of designing complex integrated circuits (ICs) and is an integral part of modern VLSI design flows.

Important terms used

- Synopsys Design Constraints(SDC) : These are the design constraints which are supplied to DC to enable appropriate optimization suitable for achieving the best implementation.
- .lib : Design Library which contains the Standard cells.
- .db : Same as .lib but in a different format. DC understands libraries in .db format
- .ddc : Synopsys propreitary format for storing the design information. DC can write out and read in DDC.
- Design : RTL files which has the behavioral model of the design.

```
        Step 1     Read STD Cell/tech.lib
			 
	Step 2	Read Design (Verilog and Design.lib)
			 
	Step 3	Read SDC
			 
	Step 4	Link the Design
			 
	Step 5	Synthesize
			 
        Step 6  Generate Report and analyse QoR
			 
        Step 7  Write out the Netlist
```

The DC compiler does not understand .lib , so the .lib is converted to .db format. lib format is for user reference.

**Labs on Design Vision**
To launch Design Vision we need to enable c shell and then give design Vision:
```
csh
design_vision

After launching the design_vison first we need to the net to .ddc which is read by Design_vision tool which can be done by using the below command
```
set target_library /Path_to_library(.db)
set link_library {* /Path_to_library(.db)}
link
compile
write -f verilog -out file.v
write -f ddc -out file.ddc

```
Then we can start GUI and then read the .ddc file generated above. This ddc file contains all the information of the tool memory of that particular session. ddc is synopys proprietary format i.e it can be read only br synopsys tools.When the .db is read it automatically reads the linked .db file.
If we have an RTL design that we want to synthesize and we have the Verilog code available, we would typically use read_verilog to start the synthesis process. However, if we have a DDC-formatted design from a previous run or from another tool in the Synopsys toolchain, we would use read_ddc to work with that design in Design Compiler's GUI or command-line environment.
When we click lab1 and then schematic we get the schematic view of the Design show below:

1. While Loop:
while is used for repeating a block of code as long as a condition is true.

Example:

```
set i 0
while {$i < 5} {
    puts "Iteration $i"
    incr i
	}
```

2. For Loop:
for is used for iterating over a range or a list.

Example:
```
for {set i 0} {$i < 5} {incr i} {
    puts "Iteration $i"
}

Key Points
1. set is used for creating and storing information in the variables
2. We use $ to use any variable that is set when required to be seen as operating
3. Square brackets are used for nesting of commands in TCL.
4. Make sure there are spaces before "{" and after "}" to avoid any errors
5. Wrong manipulation might lead to infinite loop so make sure you use the variables properly.
6. "\" is used if we need write in next line in tcl file but to be considered as continuation of the current line according to the code.
7. foreach_in_collection is specific to synopsys not common in TCL.
8. We can differentiate between list and collection by printing them if it has {} at start and end it is a collection else it is a list.

## Day-7-Basic of STA

<details>
<summary> Introduction to STA </summary>

STA breaks down the design into time pathways before doing timing analysis. The following factors make up each time path:

Startpoint: The beginning of a timing route in which data is launched by a clock edge or must be ready at a certain moment. Every startpoint must be a register clock pin or an input port.

Combinational logic network: It includes elements with no internal state or memory. AND, OR, XOR, and inverter elements are allowed in combinational logic, but flip-flops, latches, registers, and RAM are not.

Endpoint: When data is caught by a clock edge or when it needs to be provided at a specified moment, this is the end of a timing path. A register data input pin or an output port must be present at each endpoint.

Static timing analysis calculates a maximum delay using the longest way and a minimum delay using the shortest path.

A Setup time (Max Delay Constraint) refers to a design specification or requirement that imposes an upper limit on the delay a signal can experience while propagating through a specific path or circuit within an integrated circuit. Consider a example of 2 D flip flop connected with a combinational logic in between them.

Tck >= Tcq + Tcomb + Tsu

Hold time (Min Delay constraint) refers to a design specification or requirement that sets a minimum allowable delay for a signal to propagate through a specific path or circuit within an integrated circuit. This constraint is used to ensure that certain signals within the circuit do not propagate too quickly, which can lead to timing violations and
